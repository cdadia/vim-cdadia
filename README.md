# My VIM setup

## Acknowledgements

Forked from https://github.com/matschaffer/vim-matschaffer and modified for my configuration.

Incorporated a number of ideas from other vimrcs.

## Installation

NOTE: This will move your existing .vimrc to .vimrc.bak and create a new .vimrc

ALSO NOTE: This assumes your default Vim is available from the `vi` command. If this is not the case, run `:BundleInstall` inside vim after installing.
